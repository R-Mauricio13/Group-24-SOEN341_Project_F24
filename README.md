# Peer Assessment Application

This web application is designed to allow students to evaluate anonymously the contributions and performance of their teammates based on four key dimensions:

- **Cooperation**
- **Conceptual Contributions**
- **Practical Contributions**
- **Work Ethic**

This system allows students to improve themselves through their feedback.

## Project Overview

The Peer Assessment Application is designed to facilitate team-based evaluations in university settings. It allows students to anonymously assess their teammates' contributions across four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic.

## Key Assessment Dimensions

Students evaluate their teammates anonymously based on four crucial aspects:

1. **Cooperation**: Active participation in meetings, communication, teamwork, assistance to teammates, and task volunteering.
2. **Conceptual Contributions**: Research, quality of input, idea generation, concept integration, problem identification, and approach suggestions.
3. **Practical Contributions**: Report writing, peer review, feedback provision, work organization, and presentation preparation.
4. **Work Ethic**: Positive attitude, respect for teammates and their ideas, commitment fulfillment, and deadline adherence.

## Problem Statement

In university team projects, it's often challenging to accurately evaluate individual contributions and provide constructive feedback. Traditional assessment methods may not capture the nuances of teamwork or encourage honest peer evaluations.

## Proposed Solution

Our Peer Assessment Application addresses these challenges by:

1. Providing a secure, anonymous platform for peer evaluations
2. Offering a comprehensive assessment framework based on four key dimensions
3. Facilitating feedback sharing and performance improvement
4. Giving instructors valuable insights into team dynamics and individual contributions

## Key Features

### For Students

- Secure login system with role-based access

- Course roster import feature

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS,React
- **Backend**: NodeJs
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Additional**: Java


## Sprint 1 Focus

1. GitHub Repository Setup:
Create and organize a GitHub repository named <team_name-SOEN341_Project_F24>.
Structure it with subfolders for each sprint's deliverables, such as meeting minutes.
2. Documentation:
Prepare a README file that includes a project description and details about team members and their roles.
Develop a sprint plan, detailing user stories and task breakdowns using GitHub issues.
Maintain logs of each team member's contributions, including time spent on activities.
Record meeting minutes in files named appropriately for easy tracking.
3. Initial Functionality:
Implement and demonstrate at least one feature related to "User Authentication & Team Management.
